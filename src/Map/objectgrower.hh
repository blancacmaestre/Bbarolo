/// @brief A class to manage the growing of objects to a secondary
/// threshold
/// @details This class provides a mechanism for handling the
/// growing of objects. By keeping track of the state of each pixel,
/// through an array of flags indicating whether a pixel is
/// available or in an object, it is able to efficiently grow the
/// objects from pixels on the edge, rather than spending time
/// examining pixels that are completely surrounded by other object
/// pixels.
